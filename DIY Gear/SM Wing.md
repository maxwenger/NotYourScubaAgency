# DIY Wing Construction

## Existing knowledge
* Scubaboard post containing a tutorial on SM wing construction https://www.scubaboard.com/community/threads/diy-wing-tutorial-very-picture-heavy.548895/

As a part of my adventure in DIYing a full sidemount harness setup, one of the most difficult aspects to produce is the wing. My intial designs were based upon the Scubaboard tutorial in the Existing knowledge section. However I needed to divert from that tutorial due to difficulties that were encountered. The design parameters for the wing were: 
* Suit a Mexico style harness.
* Have at least (and ideally close to) 30lbs of lift.
* Attach via bungees to the harness.
* Maintain a reasonably low profile in the water.
