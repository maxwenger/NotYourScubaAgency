# Choosing the best mask

A mask is arguably the most important part of your complete scuba diving system, but you are also expected to make a decision on this piece of kit before you even take your open water class!

This leaves a lot of people wondering: "What is the best mask I can buy?".

Well, that's a loaded question, the best mask is the one that fits you, but there are few things you should look between the masks *that fit you*.

Let's take a look at some of my favorite masks and allow me to talk a little bit about the features of each one!

## Tusa Masks

Tusa masks are probably my favorite for now. They fit so many different face shapes and have an extremely soft silicone skirt.

### [Tusa Freedom Ceos](https://tusa.com/us-en/TUSA/Masks/Freedom_Ceos)

The Tusa Freedom Ceos is the first mask I have someone try on when I am trying to fit them for a mask. Most of the time, this will fit them on the first try. One unique feature of this mask is that the left and right lenses are interchangeable. This makes it very easy to make prescription lenses for.

If you need prescription lenses, and this mask fits you, this would be my recommendation.

### [Tusa Freedom Elite](https://tusa.com/us-en/TUSA/Masks/Freedom_Elite)

The Tusa Freedom Elite has nearly the same fit as the Freedom Ceos, but it has a single lens instead of two, giving you much more visibility compared to the Ceos. As with the Ceos, this mask will fit nearly everybody, but it is a tad taller than the Ceos.

### [Tusa Freedom Elite HD](https://tusa.com/us-en/TUSA/Masks/Freedom_HD)

The Tusa Freedom Elite HD has all the same features of the Elite, but this mask is very tall. If you have a large face and a large forehead, this mask will probably fit you better than any other mask.

## Frameless, Low Volume, Black Skirt Masks

This is the standard for a good mask for a few reasons.

* **A frameless mask** is comfortable because it is only glass and silicone (not every single-lens mask is frameless. See the Tusa Freedom Elite: there is a frame that separates the silicone and the glass).
* **A low volume mask** is easy to clear because it doesn't contain a lot of water if it gets flooded. It also provides very good visibility because the glass fits so close to your face that its almost as if there is no skirt on the mask.
* **A black skirt** is nice because the clear skirt tends to have a lot of glare, and peripheral vision isn't obscured very much because the glass fits so close to your face.

### [Hollis M1](https://www.hollis.com/mask-m-1/) and [OMS Tribe Mask](https://www.divedui.com/products/oms-tribe-mask)

Both of these masks are the exact same, aside from the logo on the top. Although the Hollis M1 was the original, OMS uses the exact same mold. This mask was originally designed for sidemount divers to be able to see their gauges better. They did this by giving it a very deep tear-drop shape lens, so you will notice the visibility downward is extremely good because of that. I have found that this mask is on the narrower side in terms of fit.

### [OMS Tattoo Mask](https://www.divedui.com/collections/masks/products/oms_tattoo_mask_ultra_clear_lens)

I personally have owned and used both the Hollis M1 and the OMS Tattoo. I found that my face was too wide for the M1, but this mask fits me very well.

This mask has nearly the same features as the M1 mask, except it comes in more variants and colors! I have never used the UV variant underwater, but it works like a pair of sunglasses on the surface. As for the color variants, I own the white one, and I don't find the color of the mask to be bothersome when diving.

Overall, I love this mask and would recommend it to anyone who wants an M1, but their face is too wide for it.

## Mid-Sized Masks

Mid-Sized masks are masks designed for very narrow and small faces. They are usually variants of other masks, but a mid-size mask is a perfect solution for someone who is too small for other scuba masks!

### [Atomic Subframe Midsize](https://www.atomicaquatics.com/masks_subframe.html)

This is my go-to mask when I try to fit someone with a slim face or older kids. It's just a tad narrower than most masks, and can usually fit those smaller faces! It also has two lenses, so it can easily be fitted for prescription lenses!

## Checking the Fit of a Mask

You will know it when a mask fits. I have done entire dives without a mask strap because my mask fits so well. Your goal should be to find a mask that fits your face as perfectly as possible because it will not only be the most comfortable but it will be much less likely to leak during your dive.

The part of the mask that actually does the sealing is the outside part of the mask skirt. The mold of the skirt should naturally fit the curvature of your face. Do the following to check how well the mask fits your face

1. Remove the mask strap or fold it in front of the mask.
2. Look straight up at the ceiling
3. PLACE the mask on your face. Do not suck in, do not force it onto your face, just lightly place the mask on your face.
4. Have a friend or a professional look for gaps between the outside skirt of the mask and your face. Make especially sure to check under the nose, on the forehead, and on the temples.
5. Remove some air from the mask by gently sucking in through your nose or gently pushing the mask closer to your face.
6. The mask should effortlessly stick to your face as you move your head to a forward facing position (from looking straight up.)
7. Try to remove the mask while there is still some suction. It should take a little effort, but shouldn't be too hard to take off.

Masks are a very picky thing. If at all possible, I would recommend that you get professionally fitted for a mask. It's impossible to choose a mask for someone without having them try it on, so go support your local dive shop and have them help you with this one!
