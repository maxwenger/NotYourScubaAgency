# [Orcatorch D520 Review](https://www.amazon.com/ORCATORCH-Flashlight-Submarine-Underwater-Battery/dp/B01LGM87MS)

For SCUBA divers, lights are not only a tool you use at night to be able to see all the things underwater, but it's primarily a safety device. Even if it is bright-as-day out, I will still bring multiple lights because lights make communicating with your buddy so much easier. But especially at night, a simple light failure could turn out to be a big issue if you don't have another to rely on for both communicating and getting safely back to the shore or boat.

## Construction

This light is quite small. It's about an inch shorter than a dollar bill, and the thickness of a quarter. I see this as a feature because it can stow so nicely under your D-ring on your harness. I've had larger lights sit there, and it's not nearly as comfortable (see the DRIS 1k light. About the same length, but much thicker, this is very hard to manage on a D-ring because of its thickness).

It feels very sturdy. There are no plastic pieces on the light at all, and the aluminum does not have any give or play in it, even without the battery. The clip on top has plenty of material, and I don't have any concerns about the stability of that. The glass feels very hard. I tried scratching it with a knife made of VG-10 steel, and it did not scratch at all. The inside is also coated with a corrosion-resistant brass that helps protect the light if you end up with any seawater in the light.

With it being all metal, there are no buttons (no matter how magnetic) to fail. The only way to activate the light is with the (very comfortable) rotary switch. So because of that, it's easy to rinse because there are not many nooks and crannies for salt to hide in.

## Rotary Switch

This has to be one of the best rotary switches I have ever used. I was first concerned about how easy it would be to activate this light because of how small it was, but because of how far the rotary switch extends on the light, it makes it easy to find and activate the switch. This is especially important as a backup light because you don't want to be hunting for a button or something small to turn it on.

## Batteries

I cannot praise Orcatorch and Outdoor Equipment Experts enough for making this light run on one 18650 battery, and including a two-battery charger. 18650s are one of the best batteries made today, and they are very easy and cheap to find. Most of my other lights run on them, so I have them in excess, and I only need to take one type of battery with me on my dive. This is one of those things that you don't really think about until you have already bought the light, but are very important.

## Beam

The beam angle is very appropriate for a backup light. As a backup light, I want something that has a small enough beam angle to cut through any silt to signal to my buddy. This light fits that bill.

## Conclusion

I would highly recommend this light as a backup light or a recreational primary. It's very simple to use, as there is only one mode (no more accidentally putting your light into strobe mode). It's compact so it can be worn comfortably on your harness compared to other lights. It's also very durable, so I'm not worried about throwing it around on a boat, at a beach, or in the bucket full of the rest of my dive gear. This is the simplest and most convenient light I have ever used because of the rotary lock and the common battery, and I would have no hesitation recommending this light to anybody, regardless of their diving aspirations.
