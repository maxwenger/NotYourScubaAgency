# What is Nitrox, and when do I need it?

If you have been around enough divers, I am sure you could name the guy that has the green-and-yellow *enriched air nitrox diver* written on just about every piece of dive gear he owns, but what does that actually mean?

## What is Nitrox

Nitrox is the chemical name for a gas composed of both nitrogen and oxygen. If you remember from your open water class, the normal air we breathe is 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen... So you have been diving nitrox this whole time without even knowing it! But that's not what most divers are referring to when they say "Nitrox" (except for the very pedantic ones, like myself). They are referring to *enriched air* nitrox, a special mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, where the oxygen content is *enriched*.

### Okay fine, what is *Enriched Air Nitrox*

**For Nitrox to be considered Enriched Air Nitrox (EANx), it needs to contain an oxygen content that is greater than 21%.** 

## What does Enriched Air Nitrox do for me?

EANx has a lot of cool benefits! As we learned in our open water class, us as divers need to manage the amount of nitrogen that gets dissolved in our blood so we don't get [bent](https://youtu.be/jhWgG7Tm6qc?t=77) like a pretzel. What makes EANx special, is that we replace some of the nitrogen with oxygen, so less nitrogen gets dissolved in the blood. Because we ongass less quickly, we can stay down longer! We also can have shorter surface intervals than our air-breathing counterparts because we ongassed less throughout the dive.

## So why do I need a certification for EANx?

No, it's not big-scuba trying to pull tricks to eat up your scuba budge. Diving EANx requires much more planning and a bit more (dare I say) math.

Oxygen is a very corrosive gas, and as the ambient pressure increases, your body is exposed to an increased amount of oxygen (just as your body takes on more nitrogen as you go deeper, you also get exposed to more oxygen). This is an issue because we can actually "overdose" on oxygen called oxygen toxicity, and that can cause us to convulse underwater, which usually turns deadly.

The certification class teaches you how to safely manage oxygen levels and how to correctly plan the longer dives and shorter intervals you can execute with EANx.

## What should I expect when buying EANx?

As your local dive shop tank sherpa, I can fill your tank with a nitrox mix that contains a greater percentage of oxygen. I will expect you to tell me what percentage you would like (the **x** in EAN**x**), that you will calculate depending on how deep you expect to go (as to prevent oxygen toxicity).

You will commonly hear about two standard mixes -- 32% and 36%. These are also referred to as NOAA Nitrox I and NOAA Nitrox II. These are both standard mixes, and your dive shop might bank one of these mixes. If they banked a mix, it would make it as easy as filling your tanks with air! If they don't bank the mix that you would like, it may take over eight hours to mix your nitrox because I would have to blend a custom mix just for you, so bring your tanks in early with plenty of time for me to mix them if I have to!

When you come to pick up your tank, I will ask you to analyze your tanks to determine the percentage of oxygen in that tank, and label it (but its best practice to analyze them just before you dive with it too). I will then ask you to fill out a log book where you state the percentage of oxygen, the depth you may take it to without a high risk of oxygen toxicity, your nitrox certification number, and your signature. So don't forget to bring your card to the dive shop!

## Do I need to buy more gear for EANx?

Maybe, maybe not, but you will probably need to get your tanks checked.

Scuba tanks are the pickiest thing when it comes to servicing gear. Hydro every five years, a visual inspection every year, etc. It doesn't get better with nitrox. Because EANx has a greater percentage of oxygen, and oxygen is very corrosive, we need to make sure your tank is clean enough to put EANx in. Your visual inspections sticker will usually notate this. If it's not clean enough, it doesn't mean you can't have nitrox in that tank, it just means we will probably need to clean it.

Most regulators today come ready for all mixes of recreational nitrox. So, your regulator will probably work. If you have any questions about that, ask your local dive shop or your nitrox instructor.

If you don't have a computer yet, now is when you should get one. Most computers today have an EANx mode where you can put what EANx mix you are using into the computer and it will help you track your extended NDLs and make sure you don't tox out on oxygen.

If you have a drysuit, make sure you have proper drysuit undergarments, because some material that is not designed for scuba can catch fire because of the increased percentage of oxygen.

## What should I expect in the EANx class

Its all classroom work, and it has no required dives! Diving with EANx requires no extra in-water-skills. It doesn't feel any different (although some may argue it does), it doesn't taste any different, and you don't change any of your skills because you are diving with EANx.

The class usually takes 3 to 4 hours, not including book work, and they will go over all the required calculations, how to analyze tanks, and go deeper into some of the things this article talked about. If you do take the class, bring your computer so you can have your instructor teach you how to set your computer for diving EANx.

## When should I finally cave and take the class

If you are diving locally, the extra cost of EANx over air usually isn't worth it. Most of my diving happens within an hour of my house, so I have done the site more than a few times. I don't mind the limited NDLs a lot of the times because I can get a good dive in within my air limits because I know the sites. Having a shorter surface interval doesn't bother me too much either, because I can just go get a sandwich.

If I am spending a lot of money on a vacation with only a few dive days, I want to get as much diving in as I can, so having the shorter surface intervals and being able to spend more time in the water is a big deal to me.

So, my recommendation would be to either just take the class to get it out of the way or wait until you have a vacation planned to take it.

Being able to dive with EANx is something any serious diver should be able to do because it opens up so much more diving to them. Talk to your local dive shop to get a class signed up, and then you can deck all your stuff out with that flashy green and yellow!

Safe diving!
